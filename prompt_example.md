## Benefits of Joining a Trade Agreement
### Trade Creation
Joining a free trade agreement leads to significant economic advantages, including:
- **Expanded Export Markets:**
  - Increased revenues for domestic producers.
- **Access to Cheaper and Higher Quality Goods:**
  - Consumers benefit from products sourced from member countries.
- **Increased Trade Volumes:**
  - Greater integration boosts the overall trade among member countries.
- **Specialisation and Economies of Scale:**
  - Enhanced productivity and efficiency in local industries through specialisation.
- **Encouragement of Innovation:**
  - Competition among members drives technological advancements and innovation.
- **Economic Growth:**
  - Leveraging comparative advantage fosters growth and raises standards of living.
- **Flexibility:**
  - Free trade agreements can adapt to the needs of members.

Greater economic interconnection consistently correlates with stronger economic performance.
  ➢ During the first 10 years of the EU’s economic integration, member nations’ economies grew by over 500%.

## Costs of Joining a Trade Agreement
### Trade Diversion
- **Loss of Export Markets in Non-Member Nations:**
  - Member countries may redirect trade to bloc partners, reducing opportunities for non-members.
- **Retaliatory Measures:**
  - Non-members may impose higher tariffs on exports, as seen with the EU’s Common Agricultural Policy.
- **Loss of Access to Cheaper Goods:**
  - Non-member goods may become more expensive or unavailable.
- **Government Revenue Loss:**
  - Reduction or elimination of tariffs results in diminished tax revenue.
- **Structural Change:**
  - Increased competition can lead to downsizing of industries and higher structural unemployment.
- **Subsidisation of Inefficient Industries:**
  - Agreements like the EU’s CAP, which accounts for >23% of farmers’ income, protect inefficient producers.
- **Regional Bias:**
  - Certain regions may benefit disproportionately, creating economic imbalances.
## Free Trade Agreements: Stepping Stones or Stumbling Blocks?
### Are FTAs Stepping Stones or Stumbling Blocks?
- **Stepping Stones:**
  - Regional and bilateral agreements encourage economies to reduce protectionism within smaller groups, potentially leading to global free trade over time.
- **Stumbling Blocks:**
  - Fragmenting the world into separate trading blocs can prevent broader trade liberalisation.
  - Post-COVID, governments have prioritised secure supply chains and local production, weakening momentum for trade liberalisation.

#### Impact of Free Trade Agreements
**Strains in the China-US Relationship**
- **Trade Relationship:**
  - The US and China, as the world’s two largest economies, have a bilateral trade relationship with significant global implications.
  - In 2023:
    - US imports from China: US$3.8 trillion.
    - China imports from the US: US$3.1 trillion.
- **Trade Wars:**
  - Under President Trump, US tariffs on Chinese goods rose from 3% to 20%, with China imposing tariffs on over half of US imports.
  - These measures reduced the US trade deficit with China by US$108 billion but led to:
    - US goods being sourced from other countries rather than boosting domestic production.
    - Loss of 300,000 jobs in the US
    - A reduction of US$1.7 trillion in US stock market value.
- **Biden Administration:**
  - Retained many tariffs and introduced measures targeting US$18 billion worth of Chinese imports, focusing on critical sectors like chip manufacturing.


**Under the Australia-United Kingdom FTA:**
- **Sheep Meat Exports:**
  - Increased by 34.5%, from $31 million (Q3 2022) to $41.7 million (Q3 2023).
- **Beef Exports:**
  - Increased nearly fourfold from $4.2 million to $16.6 million during the same period.

**Protectionist Practices**
- Regional trade agreements often lead to:
  - Local Content Requirements:
    - Subsidy programs and export restrictions prioritise regional over global value chains.
  - Stringent Rules of Origin:
    - Higher regional value content requirements hinder extra-regional trade.
- **Impact:**
  - Such practices conflict with multilateral trade rules, increasing integration costs and reducing global efficiency.


**Geopolitical Challenges**
- The rise of regionalisation, reshoring, and de-globalisation threatens global economic interdependence.
- World Bank Assessment:
  - Protectionism undermines economic complexity, poverty reduction, and technological innovation.
  - Maintaining the benefits of globalisation in the face of fracturing trade systems is a significant challenge for trade policy.
